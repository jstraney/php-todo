# PHP ToDo App

A basic CRUD (create, read, update, destroy) app to show how a LAMP stack app could be built.

Just download and place in your htdocs (or public_html) directory of your local server. You may need to edit the db.php file to change mysql credentials if you do not have access for root mysql user with blank password.

You will also need to create a database named php_todo with the correct schema. (can be done by
copying and pasting the todo.sql file into PHPmyAdmin or running with 'mysql -u root < todo.sql'

With the database and table created, and appropriate MySQL user configured, the application should run out of the box and is yours to explore and learn from.
